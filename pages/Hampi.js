        Hampi was founded in the middle of the 14th century by two princes named
        Hakka and Bukka. Most of the temples in the Hampi district were built
        between 1336 and 1570 CE during the Vijayanagara empire. The site
        consists of about 1600 monuments and is spread over an area of 41.5
        square kilometres.

        Hampi is also famous for its close resemblance to the kingdom of
        Kishkindha which is described and mentioned in the Ramayana. It is here,
        at Anjaneya Hill, that Hanuman is believed to have been born. The city,
        where many structures are made from granite, lime mortar and bricks, is
        addressed as the Ruins of Hampi because of numerous remains of ancient
        architecture that are currently in the city.{" "}
